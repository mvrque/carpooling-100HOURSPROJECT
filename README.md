This is a project where i spend a lot of time. 

I am making full-stack car sharing application, where drivers can get a little money for rides and passengers will save time and comfort riding with crowded public transport everyday. 

Idea is this - if you are going to the same place very often you can request a carpool! Drivers and passenger both can put in their daily routes and accept them. If you accept the request you can talk to driver/passenger directly. Every time you complete a ride you get some points/rating for showing that you are trustworthy.
