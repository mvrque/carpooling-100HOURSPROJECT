                <p>Look no further - carpooling is here. There are so many people riding alone in the car on the same route.

                Drivers will get compensated for the gas and not ride empty car every morning. Passengers dont have to wait and ride with crowded buses twice or even third the time they could with a car. It is a win-win situation!</p>
